# 👻 Pac-Man Ghost AI (Python + Pygame)

A Python-based Pac-Man clone featuring intelligent ghost behaviors using A*, BFS, and Minimax (with Alpha-Beta pruning). Each ghost simulates a distinct chasing strategy, replicating classic arcade mechanics and enhanced with modern AI pathfinding techniques.
